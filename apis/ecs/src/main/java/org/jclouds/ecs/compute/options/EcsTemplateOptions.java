/**
 * Contains options supported in the {@code ComputeService#runNode} operation on
 * the "ec2" provider. <h2>
 * Usage</h2> The recommended way to instantiate a EC2TemplateOptions object is
 * to statically import EC2TemplateOptions.* and invoke a static creation method
 * followed by an instance mutator (if needed):
 * <p/>
 * <code>
 * import static org.jclouds.aws.ec2.compute.options.EC2TemplateOptions.Builder.*;
 * <p/>
 * ComputeService client = // get connection
 * templateBuilder.options(inboundPorts(22, 80, 8080, 443));
 * Set<? extends NodeMetadata> set = client.createNodesInGroup(tag, 2, templateBuilder.build());
 * <code>
